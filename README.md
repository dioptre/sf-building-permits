## Installation

Install the dependencies:

```sh
yarn install
```

> Note: I used `yarn` but you can just as easily switch out the `yarn` statements with
> `npm`.

## Running locally

Start up the development server with hot reloading:

```sh
yarn run dev
```

## Deploying

To generate the optimized build, simply run:

```sh
yarn run prod
```
